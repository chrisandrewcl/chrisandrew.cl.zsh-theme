</p>

This is a custom theme I made for my personal use, so I did not bother thinking of a good name for it.

If you want to try it, it depends upon icon fonts (such as [Awesome Terminal Fonts](https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts) and [Powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)). 

It looks great on [Guake](https://github.com/Guake/guake) with [Solarized Dark Higher Contrast palette](https://github.com/Guake/guake/blob/master/guake/palettes.py#L657) and 5% transparency.
